  abstract =    {Spatial accessibility is a powerful tool for understanding how access to important services and resources varies across space. While spatial accessibility methods traditionally rely on origin-destination matrices between centroids of administrative zones, recent work has examined creating polygonal catchments - areas within a travel-time threshold - from point-based fine-grained mobility data. In this paper, we investigate the difference between the convex hull and alpha shape algorithms for determining catchment areas and how this affects the results of spatial accessibility analyses. Our analysis shows that the choice of how we define a catchment produces differences in the measured accessibility which correlate with social vulnerability. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and communicating minor methodological choices in spatial accessibility analyses.},

  abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients could not receive timely healthcare services due to limited availability and access to healthcare resources and services. Previous studies found that access to intensive care unit (ICU) beds saves lives, but they overlooked the temporal dynamics in the availability of healthcare resources and COVID-19 cases. To fill this gap, our study investigated daily changes in ICU bed accessibility with an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method in the state of Texas. Along with the increased temporal granularity of measurements, we uncovered two phenomena: 1) aggravated spatial inequality of access during the pandemic, and 2) the retrospective relationship between insufficient ICU bed accessibility and the high case-fatality ratio of COVID-19 in rural areas. Our findings suggest that those locations should be supplemented with additional healthcare resources to save lives in future pandemic scenarios.},

However, the computational capabilities needed for this potential transformation still remain only accessible to a small set of domain experts, hampering the engagement and contribution from the broader water research community. We have developed a domain-specific online computing platform, called CyberGIS-Jupyter for Water (CJW), that aims to integrate advanced cyberinfrastructure and geospatial capabilities for serving the broad water science communities. CJW represents a novel cyber-based geospatial information science and systems (cyberGIS) framework for harnessing distributed high-performance computing resources to enable collaborative and large-scale hydrologic analysis and modeling. CJW provides a stack of integrated geospatial software tools and libraries to facilitate collaborative and reproducible workflows that have been made interoperable with HydroShare, a web-based hydrologic data and model sharing platform, to expand community access. This talk presents the design and implementation of CJW, and demonstrates its capabilities with several success stories from users and a case study on computationally intensive hydrologic modeling based on WRF-Hydro.},

In this research, a computational spatial method for estimating access was applied to measure distance to services from all points of a city or state while considering the size of the population in need for services as well as both driving and public transportation. Specifically, this study employed the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method to measure spatial accessibility to HIV testing, treatment (i.e., Ryan White HIV/AIDS program), and prevention (i.e., Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis [PrEP]) services. The method considered the spatial location of MSM (Men Who have Sex with Men), PLWH (People Living with HIV), and the general adult population 15\textendash 64 depending on what HIV services the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends for each group. The study delineated service- and population-specific accessibility maps, demonstrating the method's utility by analyzing data corresponding to the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois. Findings indicated health disparities in the south and the northwest of Chicago and particular areas in Illinois, as well as unique health disparities for public transportation compared to driving. The methodology details and computer code are shared for use in research and public policy.},

Well-tuned parameters are necessary for models to reproduce real-world multi-scale space-time patterns, but calibration is often computationally intensive and time consuming. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm that has found wide use for complex optimization including nonconvex and noisy problems. In this study, we propose to use PSO for calibrating parameters in ABMs. We use a spatially explicit ABM of influenza transmission based in Miami, Florida, USA as a case study. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a standard implementation of PSO can be used out-of-the-box to successfully calibrate models and out-performs Monte Carlo in terms of optimization and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Abstract Calibration of agent-based models (ABMs) is a major challenge due to the complex nature of the systems being modeled, the heterogeneous nature of geographical regions, the varying effects of model inputs on the outputs, and computational intensity. Nevertheless, ABMs need to be carefully tuned to achieve the desirable goal of simulating spatiotemporal phenomena of interest, and a well-calibrated model is expected to achieve an improved understanding of the phenomena. To address some of the above challenges, this article proposes an integrated framework of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and calibration, called GSA-CAL. Specifically, variance-based GSA is applied to identify input parameters with less influence on differences between simulated outputs and observations. By dropping these less influential input parameters in the calibration process, this research reduces the computational intensity of calibration. Since GSA requires many simulation runs, due to ABMs' stochasticity, we leverage the high-performance computing power provided by the advanced cyberinfrastructure. A spatially explicit ABM of influenza transmission is used as the case study to demonstrate the utility of the framework. Leveraging GSA, we were able to exclude less influential parameters in the model calibration process and demonstrate the importance of revising local settings for an epidemic pattern in an outbreak.},

  abstract     = {JupyterHub [1] has become a popular choice in many scientific communities, offering an easy-to-use interface for users with little to no frontend development work while promoting reproducible and replicable (R&R) science [2]. In the broad geospatial science community, CyberGISX [3] provides such a gateway environment with many cyberGIS (i.e., geospatial information science and systems based on advanced cyberinfrastructure) and geospatial software packages prebuilt and ready to use. Like other JupyterHub-based solutions, CyberGISX also provides container-based access for its users and must balance a trade-off between providing a static compute environment which enhances R&R and continuously updating the software environment to keep up with advances in scientific software. Solutions such as Binder [4] have attempted to address this trade-off by having required dependencies encoded in the package and building the software environment at the time of use. However, such a solution comes with two major disadvantages: (a) software is built at the time it is needed, increasing startup time and introducing the possibility that some of the dependencies of the environment are no longer available or have changed; and (b) the onus of specifying and managing software installations is passed to notebook developers, many of whom are domain scientists and not comfortable with such responsibilities. To address these challenges and enhance R&R with minimal effort from end-users, we have designed and implemented a solution on CyberGISX that allows software to be kept on an external file server mounted into each user's environment. Scientific software is installed with Easybuild [5] and managed by Lmod [6] giving a variety of benefits: (1) the compute environment is more standardized and easily reproducible outside of the gateway; (2) multiple versions of software can be made available to users without increasing container size; and (3) the exact copies of software are always available on the gateway instead of being rebuilt for every release, further enhancing R&R. We also employ an Easybuild-installed Anaconda [7] to create and manage conda environments on the file server. The combination of the software stack from Easybuild and Python environment from conda provides end-users with kernels for their Jupyter notebooks which are persistent and unchanged as the gateway's container updates. This design enhances R&R and adds functionality for advanced users without introducing technical barriers to non-technical end-users. As such, domain scientists using this solution need not build their own software and specify dependencies, which helps prevent the notebooks they have developed from getting broken by the next software release. This talk explores the new architecture and applications of this solution to CyberGISX [3] and CyberGIS-Jupyter for Water (CJW) [8].},

  abstract     = {{Geospatial research and education have become increasingly dependent on cyberGIS, defined as geographic information science and systems based on advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI), [1] to tackle computation and data challenges. However, the use of advanced cyberGIS capabilities has typically been constrained to a small set of research groups who have the technical expertise of using CI resources. Over the past few years CyberGIS-Jupyter [2,3] has been developed to provide access to cyberGIS capabilities through an easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook interface which has made cyberGIS more accessible. For many cyberGIS and geospatial applications accessing CI resources needed for solving complex problems at scale. However, leveraging CI resources for geospatial application is challenging both due to the steep learning curve and lack of appropriate tools. CyberGIS-Compute fills this gap by providing an easy-to-use middleware tool for using and contributing geospatial application codes that leverage CI resources. This substantially lowers the learning curve for both geospatial users and developers to access cyberGIS capabilities at scale. CyberGIS-Compute is backed by Virtual ROGER (Resourcing Open Geospatial Education and Research); a geospatial supercomputer with access to a number of readily available popular geospatial libraries.

With CyberGIS-Compute we have designed an easy-to-use middleware and associated Python SDK to provide access to CyberGIS capabilities, allowing geospatial applications to easily scale and employ advanced cyberinfrastructure resources. This presentation will first describe the basics of CyberGIS-Jupyter and CyberGIS-Compute, then introduce the Python SDK for CyberGIS-Compute with a simple example. Then, we will take multiple real-world geospatial applications use-cases like spatial accessibility and wildfire evacuation simulation using agent based modeling.

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. Our findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.},
