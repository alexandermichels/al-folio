	abstract = {Abstract Calibration of agent-based models (ABMs) is a major challenge due to the complex nature of the systems being modeled, the heterogeneous nature of geographical regions, the varying effects of model inputs on the outputs, and computational intensity. Nevertheless, ABMs need to be carefully tuned to achieve the desirable goal of simulating spatiotemporal phenomena of interest, and a well-calibrated model is expected to achieve an improved understanding of the phenomena. To address some of the above challenges, this article proposes an integrated framework of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and calibration, called GSA-CAL. Specifically, variance-based GSA is applied to identify input parameters with less influence on differences between simulated outputs and observations. By dropping these less influential input parameters in the calibration process, this research reduces the computational intensity of calibration. Since GSA requires many simulation runs, due to ABMs' stochasticity, we leverage the high-performance computing power provided by the advanced cyberinfrastructure. A spatially explicit ABM of influenza transmission is used as the case study to demonstrate the utility of the framework. Leveraging GSA, we were able to exclude less influential parameters in the model calibration process and demonstrate the importance of revising local settings for an epidemic pattern in an outbreak.},

	abstract = {Urban land markets exhibit complex emergent behaviors that have yet to be fully explained by the microeconomic decision-making which constitutes the market. The Agent-based Land MArket (ALMA) framework has been introduced to simulate a bilateral agent-based land market that produces a rent gradient. In this paper, we extend the ALMA framework by introducing two new parameters, heterogeneity, and stochasticity which allow us to explore how the rent gradient is affected by buyers with diverse preferences and a range of market compositions.},

	title = {Rapidly Measuring Spatial Accessibility of COVID-19 Healthcare Resources: A Case Study of Illinois, USA},
	year = {2020},
	doi = {10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x},
  	abstract = {Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study flls this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Method: The rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step foating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The E2SFCA has two major steps. First, it calculates a bed-to-population ratio for each hospital location. Second, it sums these ratios for residential locations where hospital locations overlap. Results: The comparison of the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of population at risk identifes which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. This study also identifed vulnerable population residing in the areas with low spatial accessibility in Chicago. Conclusion: Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of healthcare resources provides an improved understanding of how well the healthcare infrastructure is equipped to save people’s lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fndings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.},

This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources.

	abstract = {Despite extensive efforts on achieving reproducible agent-based models (ABMs) to improve the capability of this widely adopted methodology, it remains challenging to reproduce and replicate pre-existing ABMs, due to a number of factors such as diverse computing resources and ABMs platforms. In this study, we propose to employ CyberGIS-Jupyter for spatially explicit ABMs. CyberGIS-Jupyter is a cyberGIS framework to achieve data-intensive, reproducible, and scalable geospatial analytics using Jupyter Notebook based on advanced cyberinfrastructure. Influenza transmission in the city of Miami, Florida, USA was used as a case study. In the model, Influenza is transmitted through the contact networks of individual human agents, which are constructed based on commuting behaviors. CyberGIS-Jupyter can support one not only to conduct collaborative and transparent modeling, but also to perform modeling simulation on advanced cyberinfrastructure resources. It may contribute to boosting the reproducibility and replicability of ABMs.},

Further, the analysis is generally performed on unstructured, non-uniform, and sporadic websites which makes it difficult to algorithmically search for the information needed and complex to determine the semantic meaning of the documents even when they are found. Our work attempts to tackle these problems by building an information extraction, classification, and aggregation system which procures information and compares the statements found in the documents to a credible knowledge base. Based on computational fact-checking, we are hoping this approach will produce a better information extraction and aggregation system.},
