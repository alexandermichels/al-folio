CyberGISX/CyberGIS-Jupyter is a science gateway for education and reproducible computational geosciences. The platform provides a community, a variety of guided notebooks, and a Jupyter environment. My work has focused on deploying JupyterHub through Kubernetes and redesigning the backend to provide more flexible and reproducible compute environments.

Check out the project:

* [CyberGISXHub - Community and Notebooks](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/)
* [CyberGISX - JupyterHub](https://cybergisx.cigi.illinois.edu/hub/login)
* [The CyberGIS Center page on the project](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/project/cybergis-jupyter/)

I've also contributed a number of Jupyter notebooks to the CyberGISX Hub community notebooks. A few of those notebooks are linked below:

Similar to CyberGISX, CyberGIS-Jupyter for Water (CJW) provides a Jupyter environment for hydrological modeling and analysis that is deeply integrated with the [Hydroshare](https://www.hydroshare.org/) ecosystem. My work has focused on deploying JupyterHub through Kubernetes.
