In this project, we worked to analyze access to HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) treatments and prevention resources for the state of Illinois and Chicago. The data for reproducing our analysis [can be found in the Illinois Data Bank](https://doi.org/10.13012/B2IDB-9096476_V1). This work has been published in PLOS ONE:

Our [publication can be seen here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270404) and the abstract for the paper is as follows:

> "Accomplishing the goals outlined in “Ending the HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) Epidemic: A Plan for America Initiative” will require properly estimating and increasing access to HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services. In this research, a computational spatial method for estimating access was applied to measure distance to services from all points of a city or state while considering the size of the population in need for services as well as both driving and public transportation. Specifically, this study employed the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method to measure spatial accessibility to HIV testing, treatment (i.e., Ryan White HIV/AIDS program), and prevention (i.e., Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis [PrEP]) services. The method considered the spatial location of MSM (Men Who have Sex with Men), PLWH (People Living with HIV), and the general adult population 15–64 depending on what HIV services the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends for each group. The study delineated service- and population-specific accessibility maps, demonstrating the method’s utility by analyzing data corresponding to the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois. Findings indicated health disparities in the south and the northwest of Chicago and particular areas in Illinois, as well as unique health disparities for public transportation compared to driving. The methodology details and computer code are shared for use in research and public policy."
