I'll be presenting our work [*"Towards Reproducible Research on CyberGISX with Lmod and Easybuild"*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5569659) at the [Gateways 2021](https://sciencegateways.org/web/gateways2021/program/schedule) Conference Thursday Oct 21 at 1:50pm ET. We also had some excellent work [*"Enabling Computationally Intensive Geospatial Research on CyberGIS-Jupyter with CyberGIS-Compute"*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5570055) accepted at Gateways as a recorded talk.
