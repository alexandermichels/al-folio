I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I'm pursuing a [doctorate in Informatics](http://www.informatics.illinois.edu/informatics-phd/) with a focus in Spatial Informatics. At UIUC I work as a research assistant under Dr. Shaowen Wang at the [CyberInfrastructure & Geospatial Information Laboratory (CIGI)](http://www.cigi.illinois.edu/) and [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/). In these labs, I am part of the "Algorithms & Systems" and "Spatial Modeling" groups which allows me to explore deploying complex systems on Kubernetes and simulating complex socio-economic phenomena.

I have an interdisciplinary background which includes a Bachelors in Mathematics and Financial Economics with Honors in Computer Science and Math. This interdisciplinary undergrad from a liberal arts institution is now being supplemented by an intersectional graduate program that fits my research interests perfectly. I'm passionate about solving complex, data-driven, socio-economic problems involving space and connectivity, spurred on by an interest in graph theory and topology.

Some cool stuff I've been a (small) part of:

* [WhereCOVID-19](https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/)
