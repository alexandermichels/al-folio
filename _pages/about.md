Alex Michels is a PhD candidate studying Spatial Informatics under Dr. Shaowen Wang at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 
He is currently a research assistant at the [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/) and will be on the job market in Fall 2024.

Alex is passionate about access & cyberGIS meaning: (1) using cyberGIS to analyze spatial patterns and systems of inaccessibility and inequity and (2) making cyberGIS tools and technology accessible to all.
His work in analysis and modeling includes Spatial Agent-Based Models (SABMs) for public health and work advancing the methods of spatial accessibiliy with applications including the [WhereCOVID-19 Spatial Accessibility Explorer](https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/spatialAccess.html) for rapidly measuring spatial accessibility during the COVID-19 pandemic.
His work on [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) computing in the geosciences includes contributions to [CyberGISX](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/), [CyberGIS-Jupyter for Water (CJW)](https://go.illinois.edu/cybergis-jupyter-water/), and [CyberGIS-Compute](https://cybergis.github.io/cybergis-compute-python-sdk).

If you're interested in my work or collaborating, please feel free to reach out! If you want to chat over coffee, we can meet on campus at UIUC or I'm planning to attend these upcoming events in-person:
