Alex Michels is a research assistant at the [CyberInfrastructure & Geospatial Information Laboratory (CIGI)](http://www.cigi.illinois.edu/) and [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/). 
He is currently a PhD student studying Spatial Informatics under Dr. Shaowen Wang at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 

Alex is passionate about access & cyberGIS; meaning (1) using cyberGIS to explore, model, and analyze spatial patterns and systems of inaccessibility and inequity and (2) in making cyberGIS tools and technology accessible to all.
His work in analysis and modeling includes Spatial Agent-Based Models (SABMs) for public health and the [WhereCOVID-19 Spatial Accessibility Explorer](https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/spatialAccess.html) for rapidly measuring spatial accessibility during the COVID-19 pandemic.
His work on [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) computing in the geosciences includes working on [CyberGISX](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/), [CyberGIS-Jupyter for Water (CJW)](https://go.illinois.edu/cybergis-jupyter-water/), and [CyberGIS-Compute](https://cybergis.github.io/cybergis-compute-python-sdk).
